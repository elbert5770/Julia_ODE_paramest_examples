# Julia_ODE_paramest_examples

This is the first in what will be a collection of simplified examples that can be used as a starting point for getting started with Julia SciML via copy-and-paste.  Compared to examples in Univesal Differential Equations, etc., these examples will avoid global variables and each one will be smaller in scope.
